The goal of this is to make a new and supported OPEN SOURCE PCB that uses Field Trip design language

The pcb does not fit existing Beater Field Trip or Field Trip cases, the USB port is in the wrong location. 

Currently using STM32 controller, solder only, single layout big bar.

Future plans: 2u right shift, split bars, possible other bottom row layouts.

Case is in design stages, with a current proto inspired by M4NU's C0V3R, and a top mount version in the works. 


To get custom vial going, copy or clone the feelstrip folder into .../vial-qmk/keyboards/ and build your firmware using that
